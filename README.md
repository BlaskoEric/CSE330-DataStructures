# Homeworks

## Homework 1
* Program finds the kth largest number from a group of numbers in 
inFile.txt. Initial k numbers are read into a vector, while remaining numbers
are read one by one. If numbers are greater the k, they are inserted into
correct location, removing smallest number. Numbers less than k are ignored

## Homework 2
* Program takes an array and randomly fills it with random numbers. The rand() 
function is used to generate the random numbers. If numbers have been used already
in array, a new number that has not been used is generated until array is full

* Program takes an array and fills it with random numbers based on size of array.
A second array is used to check if the generated number has been used, if so, a new
number is generated. The process if filled until array is full

* Program fills and array with non repeating number, then randomly swapped to 
create a random array of numbers of size N.

## Homework 3
* Program finds the union and intersect of two sorted list. The list used are from the
standard library while the functions to find the union and intersect are provided above main.
Program will print the contents of both list, then print their union and intersect after

## Homework 4
* Program will test the methods in BinaryTree.h. After inserting a new value into
the tree, the program will print its count of nodes, leaves, and full nodes. It will
also state if it meets requirments for being a BST. Tree will be printed as to have
a visual of how the tree looks to compare to the data

# Labs

## Lab 1
* Program runs an algorithm to convert infix expressions into a postfix expression.
A stack is used to hold operators in order to reverse the order of the operators in 
the expression.

## Lab 2 
* **Bubble Sort, Insert Sort, Selection Sort** - Each program creates a vector of random integers of size n, which is based 
off of users input.The vector is then sorted and printed to console 

## Lab 3
* **String Class** - Implementation of the String class

## Lab 4
* **Vector Class** - Implementation of the Vector class

## Lab 5
* **List Class** - Implementation of the List class

## Lab 6
* **Queue and Stack Class** - One file contains implemenation of Queue class and another for the Stack class.

## Lab 7
* **Binary Search Tree Class** - Implementation of the Binary Search Tree class

## Lab 8
* **Set Class** - Implementation of the Set class

## Lab 9
* **Unordered Map Class** - Implementation of the Unordered Map class

## Lab 10
* **Priority Queue Class** - Implementation of the Priority Queue class
